# We use a pair of dicts that track how often we have had login attempts
# against a username or attempts for user names that do not exist.
#
# If a specific login has a bunch of login failures against it in rapid
# succession then we will actually automatically fail any further login
# attempts against this user for a short amount of time greatly impairing any
# brute force attempts to guess passwords.
#
# Also if a specific IP address attempts to login as users that do not exist
# more than a certain amount in a certain time period then we lock out that IP
# address for attempting to authenticate for a period of time greatly impairing
# any brute force attempts to suss out accounts.
#
# XXX Maybe when a remote connection hits one of those limits we
#     should just not respond (no BAD, no NO, just dead air..)

# timeout period, and the last time they tried to authenticate this user and
# failed.

# We allow one more attempt for a given address in case an address is basically
# mulitple different users (like behind a home gateway). This way the bad user
# will get locked out after 4 attempts but we will allow other users to login
# successfully from the same ip address.

    """
    We had a login attempt that failed, likely due to a bad password.
    Record this attempt.

    The failure is recorded both for the username and the address it came from.

    So a number of bad attempts locks both that username from being logged in
    from and the address the login attempt came from.

    XXX There is a fundamental flaw with this in that a malicious agent that
        knows how our throttling works can esssentially conduct a denial of
        service against usernames it knows about.

        To mitigate this somewhat we will block an IP address that has too many
        failures before we will block a username that has too many failures.

    NOTE: The purpose of the address based lockout is to shut down IP addresses
          that are trying a bunch of different user names.

    - `user`: The username that they tried to login with
    - `addr`: The IP address of the client that tried to login
